calculate confidence interval for single sample

# Confidence intervals 

In this section we'll learn to use the 't.test)' function as a way to return the condfidence interval using the t-distribution.

## Example 1 

Create a mock sample of observation values, and find the confidence interval. Then we'll learn how to report that. 

```{r}
pika_mass <- c(82, 94, 110, 5000, 86, 99, 102) 

pika_mean <- mean(pika_mass)

pika_sd <- sd(pika_mass)

pika_ci <- t.test(pika_mass)
```
degrees of freedom is measure of sample size or number of variables 
## Risky and Tedious way:

Mean pika mass at Paiute Pass is 91.9 g $\pm$ 13.5 g (mean $\pm$ 1 standard deviation, n = 7) with a 95% confidence interval of [79.4, 104.4] g.

don't manually type or copy and paste values

command return to run single line

In-line code referencing to stored objects!

Use a single backtick on either side of a lowercase r to create an in-line bit of code

## A high initial investment, but safer and better way

Mean pika mass at Paiute Passs is 
'r round(pika_mean, 1)' g $\pm$ 'r round(pika_sd, 1)' g (mean $\pm$ 1 standard deviation, n = 'r
Length(pika_mass)') with a 95% confidence interval of ['r pika_ci$conf.int[1]', 'r pika_ci$conf.int]


# Two-sample t-test

Use a two-sample t-test to test the null hypothesis that samples were drawn from populations with the same mean (difference in means = 0).

- H0: Means difference = 0
- HA: Means difference is NOT - 0

this is a two-sided t-test beacuse no directionality is implied.

## Example 1 

```{r}
oak_trees <- c (29, 19, 22, 30, 35, 16, 20, 7)

pine_trees <- c(48, 32, 41, 40, 56, 70, 30, 19, 20)
```

Is there a significant difference in mean heights for oak and pine trees? 

```{r}
trees_t <- t.test(oak_trees, pine_trees) 
```

The p-value of 'r trees_t$p.value' means that...

1.8% chance of finding sample means *at least as different as those I found* by random chance if they were drawn from populations with the same mean height.
